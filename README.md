CannoliKit is a library designed to jump-start your Discord.Net bots with advanced features like persistent state management, modular embeds, background processing, and other cool extras like pagination. It's easy to set up out-of-the-box, leveraging EF Core and dependency injection. 

Affectionately named after my orange cat, Cannoli.
